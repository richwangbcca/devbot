# Daily Challenge Discord Bot: Devbot

A personal productivity bot that sends daily coding challenges and helps manage project TODOs. Built to offset the cognitive load of planning daily coding!

## Features

### Daily Challenges
The bot randomly selects from 4 challenge types:
- **1 LeetCode Medium + Random TODO** - Solve a medium problem and work on an existing project
- **3 LeetCode Mediums** - For interview prep
- **2 LeetCode Hards** - Even more interview prep
- **1-Hour Development Sprint** - Build a mini-app from an AI-generated spec

### Project Management
- Add projects and track TODOs
- Mark items as complete
- Random TODO selection for daily challenges

## Why I Built This

As someone who often gets lost in planning, I wanted a system that would:
- Pick my daily tasks for me so I wouldn't overthink it
- Give me variety in daily challenges
- Connect interview prep with real project work
- Keep me accountable through automated daily challenges.

I just developed this as of Sept. 1, 2025, and I'm excited to use it for the upcoming year!
